In this case, if either input A or B is at logic level 1 (true), the output will be at logic level 1 as well. If both inputs are at logic level 0 (false), the output will remain at logic level 0.

In the example given, when input A is at logic level 0 and input B is at logic level 1, the output remains at logic level 0 because the OR operation requires only one true input to produce a true output. Similarly, when both inputs are at logic level 0, the output remains at logic level 0 since there is no true input to perform the OR operation on.","This image shows a 2-input OR gate, which is a basic digital logic gate that performs the logical operation of OR.

The truth table indicates that when both A and B are true (i.e., equal to 1), the output will be true (equal to 1). In all other cases, the output will be false (equal to 0).

In summary, the 3-input AND gate produces an output of 1 only when all three inputs (A, B, C) are true; otherwise, it produces an output of 0.

DIAC-Construction.PNG,"The image shows a diagram of a DIAC (Discharge Induced Arc Gap) device, which is a three-layered, layered insulated device that can be connected from an AC state to a DC state or vice versa depending on the polarity of applied voltages. The two main components of the DIAC are the PN junction and the metal electrode. In this diagram, there are two types of DIACs shown: the basic construction (1) and the symbol (6).

The structure of diac is very much similar to that of a transistor. Fig. 21.17 (ii) shows the symbol of a diac."
DIAC-characteristics-curve.PNG,"The image is a diagram that shows the characteristics of a DIAC (Differential Inductor for AC) circuit. The DIAC is composed of two main parts: the first part, labeled as ""2nd Quadrant,"" consists of a reverse breakdown voltage and a reverse current curve. The second part, labeled as ""1st Quadrant,"" includes an old state curve and a forward voltage drop curve. Both quadrants are connected by a C-E terminal and an M-O terminal.

In the 2nd Quadrant, the reverse breakdown voltage curve represents the maximum voltage at which the DIAC can be operated in reverse mode. This curve indicates that the DIAC will conduct when the voltage across it reaches this value. The reverse current curve shows the amount of current flowing through the DIAC at different voltages. As the voltage increases, the current also increases until it reaches the maximum value allowed by the DIAC's design.

In the 1st Quadrant, the old state curve represents the operating point of the DIAC when it is conducting in the forward direction. The forward voltage drop curve shows the voltage drop across the DIAC as the current increases. At this point, the DIAC acts as a voltage-controlled switch, allowing current to flow only when the voltage across it reaches a certain threshold.

The DIAC is connected to a C-E terminal and an M-O terminal. These terminals allow the DIAC to be integrated into larger circuits, such as power supplies or rectifiers.","The following characteristic curve shows the relation between the main voltage and main current of a DIAC. As you can see, the DIAC only operate in 1st and 3rd quadrant. It is a symmetrical device; therefore, the graph is symmetrical in both quadrants forming the shape of letter “Z”.In 1st quadrant, the voltage and current are positive. As you can see, when the voltage is below the break over voltage VBO, the DIAC blocks the current except for the leakage current. The device remains in OFF-state. Once the voltage increases, the DIAC triggers into ON-state and the current rises. The voltage across the device starts to reduce to steady ON-state voltage.

The device operates similarly in the 3rd quadrant. The only difference between the 1st and 3rd quadrant is that the voltage and current are reverse. That is it."

The forward conducting mode of an SCR is achieved by applying a voltage across terminals A-B and C-E.","The image is a diagram of a forward-conducting mode silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). This can be achieved in two ways:
Break Over Voltage (VB): By increasing the anode-cathode voltage beyond a specific threshold called the breakover voltage (VB), the reverse-biased junction J2 breaks down. This results in a large current flow through the SCR.
Gate Triggering: By applying a positive voltage to the gate terminal (G) relative to the cathode (K), the SCR can be triggered into conduction without requiring the voltage to reach the breakover level.

Gate-Turn-Off-Thyristor.jpg,"The image is a diagram of the Gate Turn-Off Thyristor (GTO), also known as the Gated Turn-Off Thyristor. It consists of two anodes, one cathode, and three terminals: gate, emitter, and collector. The diagram shows how the GTO works in operation.

In this circuit, the GTO is connected to a resistor, which limits the current flowing through it. The voltage across the GTO is controlled by the gate terminal, which can be used to turn the device on or off. When the gate is triggered, the GTO becomes conductive, allowing current to flow between the anode and cathode. If the gate is de-triggered, the GTO becomes non-conductive, cutting off the current flow.

The diagram also includes a rule that governs the behavior of the GTO when the gate is turned off. This rule states that if the gate is de-triggered while the current is still flowing, the GTO will continue to conduct until the current reaches zero. At this point, the GTO will automatically become non-conductive, preventing further current flow.

Overall, the GTO is a type of thyristor that allows for controlled switching of electrical current, making it useful in applications such as motor control and power electronics.",

In this circuit, the voltage across the diode is represented by Vr, which is equal to the sum of the voltages across resistors R1 and R2. This can be expressed mathematically as:

Vr = I * R1 + I * R2

where I is the current flowing through the circuit. Since the diode only conducts current when its terminal voltage is greater than its forward voltage drop (VF), we can simplify the equation to:

Vr = I * (R1 + R2)

When the diode is conducting current, the voltage across the resistor R2 is equal to the sum of the voltage across resistor R1 and the voltage drop across the diode (VF). In other words, the voltage across resistor R2 is equal to the sum of the voltage across resistor R1 and the voltage drop across the diode. Therefore, we can express the voltage across resistor R2 as:

Vr = Vf + Ir * R1

where Vf is the forward voltage drop of the diode and Ir is the current flowing through the circuit.",Norton's theorem states that any linear electrical network with multiple sources and resistors can be simplified to an equivalent circuit with a single current source in parallel with a single resistor.
