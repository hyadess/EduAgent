For example:\\n     - Y0 = NOT(A1) AND NOT(A0)\\n     - Y1 = NOT(A1) AND A0\\n     - Y2 = A1 AND NOT(A0)\\n     - Y3 = A1 AND A0\\n     \\n4. **Construction:**\\n   - Use NOT gates to invert inputs where necessary.\\n   - Use AND gates to implement the output expressions for Y0, Y1, Y2, and Y3.\\n\\n5. **Implementation:**\\n   - Connect the logic gates according to the expressions to get the desired outputs.\\n\\nThis configuration ensures that only one output is active at any time based on the input combination.'}, {'from': 'human', 'value': 'What considerations should be taken into account in terms of propagation delay and fan-out when designing a 2-to-4 line decoder using basic logic gates?'}]\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Propagation Delay:**\n",
      "   - **Minimize Delay:** Choose logic gates with low individual propagation delay to minimize the total delay from input to output.\n",
      "   - **Critical Path:** Identify the longest path through the logic gates, as it determines the overall propagation delay of the decoder.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fan-Out:**\n",
      "   - **Load Capacity:** Ensure that the output of each gate does not exceed its fan-out limit. Fan-out refers to the maximum number of inputs that a single output can drive without degradation in performance.\n",
      "   - **Gate Selection:** Use gates with adequate drive capability to handle the inputs of the subsequent gates in the circuit without causing signal distortion.\n",
