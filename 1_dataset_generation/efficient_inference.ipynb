      "2. **Key Factor**: An increase in temperature reduces the on-state voltage drop of an IGBT, increasing current flow and, consequently, power dissipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cycle**: This increased power dissipation raises the junction temperature, further reducing the on-state voltage drop, leading to a continuous cycle of increasing temperature and power loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Outcome**: If unchecked, thermal runaway can cause the IGBT to overheat and fail due to excessive temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prevention**: Proper thermal management, including adequate heat sinking and possibly active cooling, is essential to prevent thermal runaway.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Sensor Integration**: Deploy IoT devices with sensors on IGBT systems to continuously collect data on temperature, current, and voltage with high accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Connectivity**: Utilize IoT communication protocols like MQTT or CoAP to transmit sensor data to a centralized system in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cloud Processing**: Use cloud computing platforms to aggregate, store, and process large volumes of data from multiple IGBT devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement machine learning and data analytics tools in the cloud to analyze data for patterns and predict potential thermal runaway risks.\n",
